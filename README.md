# RandomGraphs
My first documented project using C++ on Random Graphs. 

In this project, I created a set of classes that abstract a mathematical graph.
The set of related classes I created and documented can be used an API.
In Demo.cpp, I showed how to use the API.

Please visit https://aalmusaw.github.io/RandomGraphs/annotated.html to see the class documentation.
All the code is in the Source Code folder.
